# Cool Color
A extension I made to waste time.

![Preview of extension](./preview.gif)

You click on the extension and then click on the "New Color" to get the new color. Wastes time when you have nothing to do.

# To download

* Clone this file using Git Clone:
```git
$ git clone https://github.com/SimpleCreations595/Cool-Color-Extension.git
```

Then turn on developer mode in your web browser, click "Load unpacked", then find the root directory of this folder.

# If using for something else
Be sure to credit me for the base extension/project.
