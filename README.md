# Cool Color
A extension I made to waste time.

![Preview of extension](./preview.gif)

You click on the extension and then click on the "New Color" to get the new color. Wastes time when you have nothing to do.

# To download

* Clone this file using Git Clone:
```git
$ git clone https://github.com/SimpleCreations595/Cool-Color-Extension.git
```

Then turn on developer mode in your web browser, click "Load unpacked", then find the "Cool Color" folder.

# If using for something else
Be sure to credit me for the base extension/project.

# Reminder
It will say the the manifest version is too old. This extension is in manifest version 2, not manifest version 3. I will fix this in the end of 2023. (To clear the error, just find the extension, click "Errors", then click "Clear All".)
